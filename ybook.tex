\chapter{Overview}

\section{Purpose}

\index{Amazon}
The provided class \ff{ybook} helps me design my books and
publish them on Amazon. You are welcome to use it too. It's easy:

\begin{listing}
\documentclass{ybook}
\begin{document}
Hello, world!
\end{document}
\end{listing}

\section{Cover Page}

A cover page must have a special formatting. You do it this way:

\begin{listing}
\documentclass[cover]{ybook}
\renewcommand*\theauthor{Jeff Lebowski}
\renewcommand*\theversion{0.1}
\renewcommand*\theyear{2021}
\renewcommand*\thevolume{1}
\renewcommand*\theprice{\$14.99}
\renewcommand*\thespinetext{new book, vol.1}
\renewcommand*\thetitle{A New Book}
\renewcommand*\theimage{images/cactus}
\renewcommand*\thetldr{Put your TL;DR text here...}
\begin{document}
\ybPrintCover{}
\end{document}\end{listing}

The PDF file generated most likely will be accepted by Amazon without
any questions.

\section{Commands}

There are a few new commands you may want to learn and use:

\index{font}
\ff{\textbackslash{}ff} makes your code fixed-font, like \ff{this one}.

\ff{\textbackslash{}tbd} makes some text \tbd{highlighted}, in order to indicate
that it will be written later.
