\maketitle

\index{Amazon}
The provided class \ff{yb-book} helps me design
\href{https://www.yegor256.com/books.html}{my books} and
publish them
\href{https://www.amazon.com/Yegor-Bugayenko/e/B01AM1QMDK}{on Amazon}.

There are a few class options you can use:

\ff{compact} --- when you need to make text more compact
and take less vertical space;

\ff{manuscript} --- when the format is not for Amazon printing,
but for some other purposes (the page size is A4), like the document
you are reading right now;

\ff{draft} --- when it's a draft for reviewers (the page size is A4)
and you want to have a watermark and a compact form of the content;

\section*{Printers}

There are a number of printers, commands that print large blocks of text
in the expected format:

\ff{\textbackslash{}ybPrintTitlePage} --- prints the first page of a book.

\ff{\textbackslash{}ybPrintTOC} --- prints the table of contents.

\ff{\textbackslash{}ybQuote} --- prints a side quote.

\ff{\textbackslash{}ybPrintBibliography} --- prints the list of bib references.

\ff{\textbackslash{}ybPrintIcons} --- prints your social icons.

\ff{\textbackslash{}ybPrintIndex[1]} --- prints index with an optional name of the section (instead of ``Index'').

For more samples, check the directory \ff{samples/}.

You are welcome to suggest additional commands, but the style
of my books is intentionally as simple as possible, avoiding formatting
as much as possible.
